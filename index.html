							<h3>Running to be your Applied Science Student Senator and AMS representative.</h3>
							<p>The Senate is the highest academic decision making body in the university where I will be a vehement advocate for the interest of APSC students. The senate is made up of students, faculty members and deans, who meet on a monthly basis. Every three years there is a new senate session that starts where priorities are set. I want to setup future senators with the best possible footing such that we can have an effective student caucus for the entire term, not just a single year. </p>
							<p>The AMS council is responsible for setting strategic priorities for the AMS, changing policy, and holding the executive accountable. As a former employee of the AMS (Sustainability Projects Coordinator), a department president (FIZZ), and a former co-captain of an engineering student team (UBC SOLAR), I have the experience required to govern effectively. I will use this experience to build bridges between organizations and lobby on your behalf to the AMS Council. </p>

									<h2>Fizz President</h2>
									<p>Over the course of the 2016-2017 academic year I was the Engineering Physics deparment club president and a member of the EUS Board of Governors. In this time I worked on a number of issues:</p>
									<ul>
									  <li><b>Hebb Renewal Project</b></li>
									  	<p>Our beloved clubroom is getting upgraded along with Hebb tower. Through this process, I have solicited student feedback, worked with multiple different campus entities, and used various personal connections to improve the space for students.I have worked tirelessly to include ENPH students in all aspects of the decision making and ensured that our needs were heard and acted upon by the project managers. The current cohort will never see this building, but I believe it is crucial that we do the best work possible to setup up the next generation of students. </p>
									  <li><b>Circumlum Consultation and Feedback</b></li>
									  <p> Every year FIZZ holds several feedback sessions so that our students can identify pain points in the program and try to rectify them. I worked with our council to ensure that feedback we received was passed up the chain and changes were made to improve the program for the better. I have been involved in this kind of work for my last three years on Fizz council, not just as Fizz president. </p>
									  <li><b>Conferences Committee</b></li>
									  <p>I worked on the conferences committee to help send delegates from the EUS to various engineering conferences. We did tons of excellent work together in committee including creating a plan to withdraw from WESST, a large change for the EUS in relation to other western engineering schools</p>

									<h2>Sustainability Projects Coordinator</h2>
									<p>Over the course of 2015 and in to 2016 I served as the AMS's Sustainability Projects Coordinator</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Student Projects</b></li>
										<li><b>Working with AMS Staff</b></li>
										<li><b>Continued Involvement on Committee</b></li>
										<p>After leaving the Sustainability office, I took an opportunity to sit on the AMS's Sustainable Project Committee, which administers the AMS sustainability fund. I am regularly involved with discussion and voting there, on project approvals and restructuring. This year that committee passed a new set of criteria to improve the process of evaluating projects. </p>

									<h2>UBC Solar Co-captain</h2>
									<p>This past year I served as UBC Solar's co-captain and over the past 2 years I was the mechancial lead of the project</p>
									<p><b>Team Leadership</b>
									<br >
									This is experience is relevant because it shows I can work and lead a team on a difficult project under many constraints. This is the kind of experience that is needed in both the Senate and AMS Council. Where the work can be grueling, hard to parse, and difficult to manage. Working on an leading this team shows that I have the personal and professional skills needed to advocate on your behalf. </p>
